multiext.parser
===============

The `multiext.parser` module provides robust tools for dissecting filenames and paths, particularly those with complex, multi-part extensions like ``.tar.gz`` or ``.project.snapshot.zip``. These functions are essential for applications that need to accurately identify file types, extract meaningful components from filenames (such as the base name or specific extension parts), or normalize suffixes for consistent processing.

Common use cases include:
  - **File Type Detection:** Identifying the true nature of a file beyond its simple ``.splitext()`` suffix. For example, distinguishing between a ``.tar`` archive and a ``.tar.gz`` compressed archive.
  - **File Organization and Routing:** Automatically categorizing or routing files based on the components of their extensions.
  - **Data Processing Pipelines:** Extracting specific information embedded in filenames, such as version numbers or content indicators, often found within multipart extensions.
  - **Filename Normalization:** Ensuring that file extensions are in a consistent format (e.g., lowercase, single leading dot) before storage or comparison.

The functions in this module form the foundation for more advanced file manipulation and validation tasks within the `multiext` library.
