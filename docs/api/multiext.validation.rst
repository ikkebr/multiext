multiext.validation
===================

The `multiext.validation` module offers functions to verify whether filenames or paths possess multipart suffixes and to validate these suffixes against a defined set of criteria. This is crucial for applications that expect files with specific complex extensions and need to ensure compliance before processing.

Common use cases include:
  - **Input File Validation:** Ensuring that files provided to a system (e.g., uploads, command-line arguments) have the expected multipart extension (e.g., ``.tar.gz``, ``.cdx.json``).
  - **Filtering and Selection:** Identifying files that match specific, potentially complex, extension patterns within a directory or dataset.
  - **Security Checks:** Verifying that filenames conform to expected patterns to prevent processing of unexpected or potentially malicious file types, especially when dealing with multipart suffixes that might obscure the true file nature.
  - **Conditional Logic:** Implementing logic that behaves differently based on whether a file has a recognized multipart suffix.

These validation tools help in building more robust and secure file processing workflows.
